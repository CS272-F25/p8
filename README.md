# 🎄 Secret Santa Website

## Overview

The **Secret Santa Website** is a festive, web project designed to reimagine the traditional Secret Santa experience for college students and small groups. Instead of a simple name generator, the site focuses on engagement and connection through features like interactive matching and a scavenger-hunt–style experience that builds excitement leading up to gift exchanges.

The project emphasizes ease of use, playfullness, and thoughtful interaction so participants can focus on the joy of giving rather than the logistics of organizing an event.
